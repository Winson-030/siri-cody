## Method 2: Setting Up the Self-Hosted Version

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.

2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

3. **Authenticate with Cloudflare**:
   - Run `npx wrangler login` to log in to your Cloudflare account.

4. **Create KV namespaces**:
   - Run `npx wrangler kv:namespace create chats` to create a KV namespace. Note down the ID.

5. **Configure the project**:
   - Update `wrangler.toml` with the namespace IDs:

   ```toml
      [[kv_namespaces]]
      binding = "siri_ai_chats"
      id = "<id>"
    ```

6. **Set up API keys**:

- Run `npx wrangler secret put API_KEY` to set the [Groq](https://console.groq.com/login) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key.
- Run `npx wrangler secret put SEARCH1API_KEY` to set the [Search1API](https://www.search1api.com/) API key.

   > **Note**: You can only set API_KEY if you don't need search function

7. **Update the LLMs Vars**:
   ```toml
      [vars]
      API_BASE= "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/"
      MODEL="llama3-70b-8192"
      SYSTEM_PROMPT="You are Siri Pro. Answer in 1-2 sentences. Be friendly, helpful and concise. Default to metric units when possible. Keep the conversation short and sweet. You only answer in text. Don't include links or any other extras. Don't respond with computer code, for example don't return user longitude."
    ```
